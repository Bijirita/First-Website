# First-Website
My first website

I'm exploring web-development at coding bootcamp with the Clubhou.se.  Our first assignment is create your first webpage
with shayhowe.  This is my attempt at creating a website that introduces myself.


- install requirements.txt `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
- start the webserver `python3 website.py`
